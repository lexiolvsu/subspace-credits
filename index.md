I'm one of the first people (if not the first) people to give positive feedback to Psych Engine, and I'm still
proud of it to this day.

Back when Psych Engine wasn't released and the Mind Games mod was only in version 0.1.1, RiverOaken (or someone
else on the team) posted the link to the GameBanana page in a modding server I was in. When I joined, it was
the latest message in the #mod-feedback channel, and I was surprised, since while we were working on the Subspace
mod, we planned to make the dialogue look like the scrapped dialogue in older versions of the game, which you can
find here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjHAk-xgeXA

The dialogue system was used in the engine, so I replied "Finally, someone who used the original dialogue", then
they replied "Haha, yeah, we tried to make it as faithful to the original game as possible".

I'm gonna be honest, when Psych Engine released and we were working on our mod, someone on the team kept asking us
to use the engine, and I didn't want to since I was too used to Kade Engine.
This didn't change until after I decided to work on it again after a few months of putting the mod on hold, after
I got used to the engine. We decided to go with two downloads, one for Psych Engine, and one for Kade Engine, like
how the Hex mod has one download for the vanilla game engine, or Kade Engine.

TL;DR:
As one of the first (if not the first) people who gave positive feedback for the engine, I would like to thank
everyone who worked or helped with both the Mind Games mod and Psych Engine.


Thanks for everything,
Lexio
